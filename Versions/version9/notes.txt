Version 9 notes-

Updates:
The following features were updated since version 7 and 8:
    behavior of attacks have been updated, delaying damage until the end of the animation.
        version 8 allow players the opportunity to block attacks by the bot
        version 9 has now updated player's attacks to behave similarly so now the bot has a chance of blocking the player's attacks

    Pause feature was bugged, being unable to pause the game depending on the situation
        version 9 has fixed the oversight and players can now pause the game anytime
        stun feature has be redeveloped but still behaves similar to previous versions

    visuals.py has been overhauled and is now more simplistic than before.
        most variables have been moved to important.py
        fight.py no longer requires visuals.py, all variables are referenced from important.player
