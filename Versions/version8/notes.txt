changes that were made in versions 8 and maybe from 7:

version8 improves behavior of attack animations. all of the bot's attacks are now reactable and are easier to react and block to.
    implemation for reactable player attacks will be included in version9

Fight.py (now fight.py) has been overhauled to be a lot more simple and straight forward within the file.
    Most if not all variables have moved over to important.py
    plans for fight.py for version9 include:
        reactable attacks for bots to block player attacks
        recreating implemation of stun feature. (issue: unable to pause or quit the game due to *while* loop within fight.py)

visuals.py had a couple of bugs which were corrected which included L_active/R_active, Bot_Attack[0] and Bot_Attack[2]
    plans for visuals.py for version9 include simplification of file and relocation of all significant variables similar to fight.py
