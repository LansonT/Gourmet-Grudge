#### Documentation:
Assignment: This project was created for Harvard's CS50X Final Project Assignment. The purpose of this project is to showcase what I have learned from this This project was developed from July 19th, 2023, to September 3rd, 2023.

Description: Gourmet Grudge is a "fighting" game that involves you attacking your opponent using knives, spoons, and forks. You face off against one of two opponents; Spaghetti-Taco was gonna be a part of the main course for Taco Tuesday, but it seems like your meal got a mind of its own and now it's throwing meatballs at you. The second threat you could face off against is the infamous teacher and Twitch Streamer, DougDoug the Pepper as he gets very upset with you showing up late to class and begins to throw his unlimited supply of Extra Virgin Olive Oil Juice. You and your opponent start off with 20 health points. Each attack is worth one health point. You're able to block attacks that stun your opponent. Attacking your opponent while they're stunned is worth two health points. whoever gets to zero first loses the match.

Technical Details: My initial goal was to make this project challenging so I aimed to make this project unique from other projects that were showcased in CS50 Fair at Yale in 2022.

During this project, I used many resources available to me; Google, CS50's Discord community as well as ChatGPT to help generate ideas and material.

Art and Design: The art was made by me with the collaboration of "Kiwi" who also created one of the visuals for the game. Kiwi has also helped me come up with ideas and concepts for this project. Everything made by me was drawn using Krita's free art program and Audacity's free audio software.
